## <B>Overview</B>

 This project is my deep dive into hands-on security operations. In this **Security Operations Center (SOC) lab**, I have set up a **honeypot**‚Äîa virtual machine exposed to the internet‚Äîto attract attackers and analyze intrusion attempts. This lab is an opportunity to strengthen my cybersecurity expertise, experiment with security tools, and better understand real-world threats.

## <B>What I Built</B>

- üåê <B>Honeypot Deployment</B>: A virtual machine designed to attract and monitor cyber attacks.
- üîç <B>Log Management</B>: Collecting and analyzing security logs using Azure Monitor.
- üìä <B>SIEM Integration</B>: Connecting logs to <B>Microsoft Sentinel</B> for in-depth security analysis.
- üó∫Ô∏è <B>Geographic Visualization</B>: Tracking attacker locations with Azure Workbooks.

## <B>Getting Started</B>

### <B>Prerequisites</B>

Before diving into the lab, I made sure I had:

- An <B>Azure account</B> ([Sign up here](https://portal.azure.com/)).
- <B>Azure CLI</B> installed ([Installation Guide](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli)).
- <B>Contributor or Owner</B> role in my Azure subscription.

---

## <B>Step-by-Step Guide</B>

### <B>1. Creating a Free Azure Subscription</B>
- Signed up at [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com/).
- Verified my identity and set up billing (Azure provides free credits for new users).

### <B>2. Setting Up the Virtual Machine (VM)</B>
- Navigated to <B>Azure Virtual Machines</B>.
- Clicked <B>Create</B> > <B>Virtual Machine</B>.
- Chose an appropriate image (e.g., Ubuntu, Windows Server) and VM size.
- Configured networking for public internet access.
- Set up administrator credentials and deployed the VM.

### <B>3. Viewing Raw Logs on the Virtual Machine</B>
- Connected to the VM using SSH or RDP.
- Inspected system logs (`/var/log/auth.log` for Linux, Event Viewer for Windows).
- Identified failed login attempts and suspicious activity.

### <B>4. Creating a Log Repository - Log Analytics Workspace</B>
- Created a new <B>Log Analytics Workspace</B> in <B>Azure Monitor</B>.
- Configured data retention and storage settings.
- Ensured logs were being collected from the VM.

### <B>5. Connecting the VM to Log Analytics Workspace</B>
- Installed the <B>Azure Monitoring Agent</B> on the VM.
- Linked the VM to the <B>Log Analytics Workspace</B>.
- Verified log collection by querying logs in <B>Log Analytics</B>.

### <B>6. Configuring the Azure Monitor Agent - Security Event Connector</B>
- Set up the **Azure Monitor Agent** in **Microsoft Sentinel**.
- Configured the **Security Events Connector** to establish a connection between my VM and Log Analytics Workspace.
- Ensured logs were being forwarded to **Microsoft Sentinel** for analysis.

### <B>7. Querying Logs with KQL</B>
- Used <B>Kusto Query Language (KQL)</B> to analyze logs.
- Queried failed login attempts and identified attacker patterns.
- Saved useful queries for continuous monitoring.

### <B>8. Uploading Geolocation Data to SIEM</B>
- Collected attacker IP addresses from logs.
- Used third-party IP geolocation services (e.g., MaxMind, ipinfo.io) to map locations.
- Stored enriched logs in <B>Microsoft Sentinel</B>.

### <B>9. Inspecting Enriched Logs - Tracking Attackers</B>
- Viewed enriched log data in <B>Microsoft Sentinel</B>.
- Identified trends in attacker locations and behavior.
- Adjusted security policies based on insights.

### <B>10. Creating a Live Attack Map</B>
- Used <B>Azure Workbooks</B> to create a real-time attack visualization.
- Mapped attack sources on a <B>geographic dashboard</B>.
- Customized data views for deeper insights.

### <B>11. Beyond the Lab - Creating Security Incidents</B>
- Set up <B>Microsoft Sentinel Incidents</B> to detect threats.
- Automated alerts for suspicious activity.
- Explored next steps for expanding my SOC lab.

---

## <B>What‚Äôs Next?</B>

- Verifying deployment in the <B>Azure Portal</B>.
- Accessing the virtual machine via SSH: `ssh adminuser@<public-ip>`.
- Exploring log data in <B>Microsoft Sentinel</B>.
- Experimenting with automation and detection rules to strengthen security defenses.

## <B>Why This Matters to Me</B>

Cybersecurity is constantly evolving, and I love staying ahead of the curve. This lab isn't just a technical exercise, it's an opportunity to apply real-world security concepts, think like an attacker, and defend like a SOC analyst. I‚Äôm always looking to improve my skills, explore new security tools, and dive deeper into cyber threat detection.

## <B>Contributions</B>

I‚Äôd love to connect with fellow cybersecurity enthusiasts! Feel free to fork this repository, contribute, or reach out with any insights or feedback!
